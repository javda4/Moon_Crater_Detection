## YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv12 Usage Guide

This repository provides instructions on how to use YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv12 for object detection tasks, including training, validation, and inference. YOLOv12 follows the same usage pattern as YOLOv8, with the only difference being that model and task calls are directed to `v12` instead of `v8`.
